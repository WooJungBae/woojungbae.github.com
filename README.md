I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Florida. I am currently working with Dr. Michael Daniels.

I am originally from South Korea. Before starting my Ph.D., I received my Bachelor’s degree in mathematics in 2016 from KyungHee University and a Master’s degree in statistics at Yonsei University. During my Master’s program, I worked as a research assistant under the supervision of Dr. Sangwook Kang.

Most of my research has centered around Bayesian methodology, causal inference, biostatistics, missing data, and building a corresponding software, but I have a broad interest in statistics.
